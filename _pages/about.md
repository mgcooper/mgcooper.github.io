I am a hydrologist in the [Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division](https://www.pnnl.gov/earth-system-science) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. My research is focused on understanding the impacts of climate change on meltwater runoff produced by melting snow and glacier ice. I use field experiments, process-based computational models, and satellite remote sensing data to understand hydrologic processes at scales ranging from mountain watersheds to the Greenland Ice Sheet.
